// \--- Day 17: Clumsy Crucible ---
// --------------------------------
//
// The lava starts flowing rapidly once the Lava Production Facility is operational. As you leave, the reindeer offers you a parachute, allowing you to quickly reach Gear Island.
//
// As you descend, your bird's-eye view of Gear Island reveals why you had trouble finding anyone on your way up: half of Gear Island is empty, but the half below you is a giant factory city!
//
// You land near the gradually-filling pool of lava at the base of your new _lavafall_. Lavaducts will eventually carry the lava throughout the city, but to make use of it immediately, Elves are loading it into large [crucibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible) on wheels.
//
// The crucibles are top-heavy and pushed by hand. Unfortunately, the crucibles become very difficult to steer at high speeds, and so it can be hard to go in a straight line for very long.
//
// To get Desert Island the machine parts it needs as soon as possible, you'll need to find the best way to get the crucible _from the lava pool to the machine parts factory_. To do this, you need to minimize _heat loss_ while choosing a route that doesn't require the crucible to go in a _straight line_ for too long.
//
// Fortunately, the Elves here have a map (your puzzle input) that uses traffic patterns, ambient temperature, and hundreds of other parameters to calculate exactly how much heat loss can be expected for a crucible entering any particular city block.
//
// For example:
//
//     2413432311323
//     3215453535623
//     3255245654254
//     3446585845452
//     4546657867536
//     1438598798454
//     4457876987766
//     3637877979653
//     4654967986887
//     4564679986453
//     1224686865563
//     2546548887735
//     4322674655533
//
//
// Each city block is marked by a single digit that represents the _amount of heat loss if the crucible enters that block_. The starting point, the lava pool, is the top-left city block; the destination, the machine parts factory, is the bottom-right city block. (Because you already start in the top-left block, you don't incur that block's heat loss unless you leave that block and then return to it.)
//
// Because it is difficult to keep the top-heavy crucible going in a straight line for very long, it can move _at most three blocks_ in a single direction before it must turn 90 degrees left or right. The crucible also can't reverse direction; after entering each city block, it may only turn left, continue straight, or turn right.
//
// One way to _minimize heat loss_ is this path:
//
//     2>>34^>>>1323
//     32v>>>35v5623
//     32552456v>>54
//     3446585845v52
//     4546657867v>6
//     14385987984v4
//     44578769877v6
//     36378779796v>
//     465496798688v
//     456467998645v
//     12246868655<v
//     25465488877v5
//     43226746555v>
//
//
// This path never moves more than three consecutive blocks in the same direction and incurs a heat loss of only `_102_`.
//
// Directing the crucible from the lava pool to the machine parts factory, but not moving more than three consecutive blocks in the same direction, _what is the least heat loss it can incur?_
